One of my favourite snacks—popcorn—is surprisingly simple to make given just the
kernels, a vessel, heat, and optional but recommended oil and seasoning. Here's how it works:

> As the oil and water in the kernel are heated, they turn into steam. Under these
> conditions, the starch inside the kernel gelatinizes and softens. The steam
> pressure increases until the breaking point of the hull is reached; a pressure
> of approximately 930 kPa (135 psi) and a temperature of <b>180 °C (356 °F)</b>.
> The hull ruptures, causing a sudden drop in pressure inside the kernel and a
> corresponding rapid expansion of the steam, which expands the starch and
> proteins of the endosperm into airy foam. As the foam rapidly cools, the starch
> and protein polymers set into the familiar crispy puff.

## Recipe

1. Set a bowl over medium-high heat
2. Add a layer of kernels and a small amount of oil
3. Season, stir or shake, and partially cover (if necessary)
4. Remove from heat once popping stops
5. Add any additional seasoning and serve

It may take a few failed attempts to lock in the appropriate settings on your
equipment, but once done it is very quick and versatile.

## Tips

-   It's important to let steam escape while popping. If using a lid make sure
    to vent it.
-   There is no correct amount, ratio, or recipe. It depends on the size of your
    vessel, the amount of oil you'd like to consume, and how you want it to taste.
    Using no oil works fine, given proper heat application.
-   There are a number of kernel varieties, types of oil, and seasonings worth
    trying. I like coconut oil and nutritional yeast, or a classic jumbo kernel
    with a bit of butter and salt.
-   Some recipes recommend adding test kernels while the oil is heating, then
    adding the rest once the test kernels start to pop. I have found this to be
    unnecessary most of the time I have made popcorn.
-   I store unpopped kernels in an airtight jar in my pantry. They last for several months
    with no noticeable degradation in quality.
-   Kettle corn can be made by adding sugar and salt when popping begins. Adding
    the sugar too early or adding too much heat can cause it to caramelize and
    burn. Caramel corn is a two-step process—popcorn and caramel are made
    separately, then combined and baked.
-   Many recipes recommend consistent shaking/stirring (including mine
    above). In my experience, this is optional. It helps to coat the popcorn
    evenly, but given heat isn't too high the kernels that pop first are lifted
    up by those that pop after them, preventing burning. This does depend on
    the vessel and amount of kernels used.
